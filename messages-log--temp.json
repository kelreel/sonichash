Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Launch**: Sonic launches on December 18, 2024.\n\n2. **Migration Period**: Starting from the launch, users holding FTM can upgrade to S tokens. \n\n3. **Two-way swap**: For the first 90 days after launch, there's a two-way swap available, allowing users to swap between FTM and S freely.\n\n4. **One-way swap**: After the initial 90 days, the swap becomes one-way, meaning you can only convert FTM to S, not the other way around.\n\nThis migration process helps transition users and validators smoothly from the Fantom chain to the Sonic network. Are you thinking about making the swap?"
